mintmpf: minimum daily air temperature [°F]. We anticipated cold snaps during the winter and heat waves in the summer may reduce cyclist counts. Hence, we used multiple temperature features.

maxtmpf: maximum daily air temperature [°F]

8amtmpf: 8 AM UTC air temp [°F]. We chose this specific time hoping to capture rush-hour temperatures.

4pmtmpf: 4 PM UTC air temp [°F]

maxdwpf: maximum daily dewpoint temperature [°F]. Dewpoint is the best indicator for the feeling of oppressive humidity. Dewpoints of 60°F are typically uncomfortable, especially during strenuous exercise.

maxsknt: maximum non-gust wind speeds [knots]. Since riding into a strong headwind saps a lot more energy from a rider than a tailwind provides, we suspected that windy days discourage cycling. Also, the windiest days can make biking dangerous by messing with a rider’s balance.

pctovc: percent of day with overcast sky cover

meanrh: time-averaged relative humidity

minalt: minimum air pressure [inches of mercury]

minvis: minimum visibility distance [miles]

minfeel: minimum apparent temperature (wind chill or heat index) [°F]

maxfeel: minimum apparent temperature (wind chill or heat index) [°F]

pctpcp: percent of the day raining or snowing

pctmdt: percent of the day with moderate or heavy precipitation

pctsn: percent of the day snowing

maxsdrct2: how far away was the wind direction from true north [compass °] when the daily maximum wind speed was logged?

maxsdrct: wind direction [compass °] at the time of maximum wind speed

amint: precipitation intensity category at 8 AM UTC (0: none, 1: light, 2: moderate, 3: heavy)

pmint: precipitation intensity category at 4 PM UTC
